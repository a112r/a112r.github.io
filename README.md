Hi! This is the repository that is currently hosting my website (a112r.github.io). 
This site is obviously made with html and some css by me, and some parts are inspired by other websites people have created before me.
It is currently a work in progress as you will see, but I will get back to working on it whenever I have free time.
If you have any questions, you can connect with me over my socials given on my github profile or even my website.
Thanks!
