#About
Hi! This is the repository that is currently hosting my website [abhishek.wiki](https://www.abhishek.wiki/). 
This site is obviously made with html and some css, and some parts are inspired by other websites people have created before me. I also used the bootstrap 4 to help make the website better across different devices and use Microsoft Clarity to track user sessions (although I have never seriously bothered to actually check them in the time it has been up).
It is currently a work in progress as you will see, but I will get back to working on it whenever I have free time.
If you have any questions, you can connect with me over my socials given at the bottom my website.
Thanks!
